# Text_Sentiment_Classification
Using pretrained model which is in RNN structure to predict the affected state of a given tweet

## Introduction
Online shopping platforms, social media platforms, and other internet applications or interactions have become part of people's daily lives. Consequently, customer reviews and community comments are readily available all over the internet, reflecting consumers' emotions and satisfaction with products or services.

From a business perspective, mining insights from the vast volume of user comments can uncover pain points and areas for improvement in products or services. As the data volume of comments continues to grow, manually reviewing each comment for sentiment analysis becomes inefficient. Therefore, automating the process to quickly analyze the emotional responses to a particular product and gain a precise understanding of pain points is essential to harness the benefits of big data effectively.

This is precisely the angle from which this project approaches the issue. Methodologically, we aim to build a deep learning architecture based on 'BERT'（Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers）. This model can automatically conduct sentiment analysis on user comments, categorizing them as positive, neutral, or negative.
